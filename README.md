# Telecom_Churn_DTree
Work on the Telecom customer Churn dataset: https://github.com/SKawsar/machine_learning_with_python/blob/main/Churn.csv 
Actual dataset source: https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/marketing-analytics-predicting-customer-churn-in-python

1. Load the dataset and perform data preprocessing
2. Which approach works better for this dataset? A. One-hot Encoding or B. Label Encoding
3. Perform Data Transformation (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler). Does Data Transformation improve model performance? Is it necessary to standardize or normalize data for tree-based machine learning models?
4. Perform Grid Search and Cross-Validation with Decision Tree Classifier
5. Show a tree diagram of the Decision Tree
6. Show the Confusion Matrix, Classification report, and ROC-AUC
7. Explain accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score
